## Overview
This project investigates the relationship between obesity and type 2 diabetes in Black and Latin communities. By analyzing demographic and health data, the study explores the prevalence of obesity and its association with diabetes, offering insights into potential disparities between these communities using the R program.

## Research Question
- **What is the relationship between obesity and diabetes in the Black community compared to the Latin community?**
- **Hypothesis**: My hypothesis for this research is that obesity is positively associated with the development of diabetes. Furthermore, I anticipate that there will be a slight
difference in this risk factor between the black community and the Latin community.

---

## Methods
1. **Data Sources**:
    - American Community Survey (ACS) data
2. **Approach**:
    - Focused on obesity and diabetes rates in counties with high percentages of Black and Latin populations.
    - Data analysis performed using R programming.

---

## Key Results
- **Black Communities**:
    - Strong correlation between obesity and diabetes (R² = 0.6225).

- **Latin Communities**:
    - Moderate correlation between obesity and diabetes (R² = 0.418).


### Visualization
The study visualizes how obesity rates correlate with diabetes in communities with varying Black and Latin population percentages.

## Conclusion
- The data have supported my hypothesis that obesity is a significant risk factor for developing diabetes. Both graphs demonstrate a clear
  association between obesity and an increased likelihood of diabetes. There was a slight difference in this risk factor between the black and the Latin communities.
  
- Upon closer analysis, I observe a slight distinction in the impact of obesity on diabetes risk between the Black and Latin communities.
  While both groups show a heightened exposure, the extent of this risk appears to vary slightly.
  
- Recognizing the unique health dynamics within different racial or ethnic communities, we can develop targeted strategies to prevent and manage diabetes effectively.
